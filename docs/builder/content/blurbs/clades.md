There are eight different kinds of clades - each with its own engine and eccentricities. 

The first five clades are synth engines. The [drum](#drum) clade uses a splicing engine for quick changes and effects. The [melodic](#melodic) clade lets you easily transpose notes of a sample. I've imported two other scripts from norns - [mx.samples](#mx-samples) and [mx.synths](#mx-synths) which essentially utilize all the sound systems from those scripts, but controllable as their own clades. There is also a brand new synth I've developed, available as its own clade as [infinite pad](#infinite-pad). 

The last three clades are for sequencing [softcut](#softcut), [crow](#crow), or [midi](#midi). These operate similarly to the synth engines, but they do not have the same versatility of effects (since all those are now controlled by their own engines).

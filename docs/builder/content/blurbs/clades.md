"Clades" are the sound engines for *zxcvbn*.

There are eight different kinds of clades - each with its own sound characteristics and eccentricities. 

The first five clades are synth engines. The [drum](#drum) clade is a sampler with a splicing engine for quick changes and effects. The [melodic](#melodic) also provides sample playback and lets you easily transpose notes of a sample. I've imported two other scripts from norns - [mx.samples](#mx-samples) and [mx.synths](#mx-synths) which essentially utilize all the sound systems from those scripts, but controllable as their own clades. There is also a brand new synth I've developed, available as its own clade as [infinite pad](#infinite-pad). 

The last three clades are for sequencing [softcut](#softcut) (another sampler), [crow](#crow), or [midi](#midi). These operate similarly to the synth engines, but they do not have the same versatility of effects (since all those are now controlled by their own engines).

The [monome grid]() holds sequences of notes that are synchronized, but separate, from all the tracks. Each track can be sequenced. Each sequence has up to 14 steps. Each step can be controlled with its own meter (pulses per measure), the number of iterations (multiplies the pulses per measure), polyphony/monophony, and order of notes.

title: Invocations
---

On the norns there a few ways to control. You can use *E1*, *E2*, and *E3* to control three parameters of the current clade. You can use *K2* and *K3* to change track and use *K1* + *K2* or *K1* + *K3* to mute or play the track, respectively. 

The main controls from the keyboard invocations. There are "Main" invocations that are used from the main TLI interface. There are also a different set of invocations when you are in a Menu (which is the same across all norns scripts) and another small set of invocations when in the sample view.

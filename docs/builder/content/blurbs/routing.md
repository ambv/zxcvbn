title: Routing

The routing of data and audio in *zxcvbn* is slightly different than traditional routing in norns. 

Audio-wise, there are additional options in the `ROUTING` parameters. While you still have access to the norns compressor and reverb, there is also an additional compressor that does sidechaining, and an additional reverb that does shimmering. The audio input is also routed in a way that lets you filter / pan the two input channels independently.

Data-wise, there is additional options in the `META` parameters to save/load archives (self-contained patches) or change startup settings.

The routing of audio in *zxcvbn* is slightly different than traditional routing in norns. While you still have access to the norns compressor and reverb, there is also an additional compressor that does sidechaining, and an additional reverb that does shimmering. The audio input is also routed in a way that lets you filter / pan the two input channels independently.

This clade is basically a port of [Aziz Ege Gonul's incredible DX7 SuperCollider code](https://github.com/everythingwillbetakenaway/DX7-Supercollider) which aims to be a "super-exact clone" of the original Yamaha DX7. The individual patches are not currently editable, but there are 16,384 presets that can be explored using the `j` command. A list of all presets can be found [here](/static/DX7-Presets.pdf). Please note that some presets are monophonic only.

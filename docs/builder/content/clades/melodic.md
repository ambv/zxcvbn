The `melodic` clade loads a single sample into memory and transposes it for each note that is being tracked. Samples are loaded in the parameters menu or by using the [sample selector](#selecting-samples).

You can visualize the sample by going to the sample screen with *tab*. Here, you can use the [sample invocations](#sample-view]) to modify the positions of each marker. There are four markers. The first marker is the play position and the last marker is the stop position. After reaching the stop position, the sound will ping-pong between the middle two markers indefinitely (to emulate a sustain in case the note is not long enough).

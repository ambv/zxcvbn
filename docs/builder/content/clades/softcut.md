This clade is a lot like the [*drum*](#drum) clade, but it uses norn's softcut as the backend. There are three voices available - each with their own buffer space and each with their own record head. This clade is unique amongst all the clades as it allows you to record via an always rotating record head that slides through the sample. The record head can be modulated by the command [just-for](#just-for) (j) as well.

It is possible to calculate onsets manully, like what is done automatically for the [drum](#drum) clade. You can either press *K1*+*K3* on the norns to detect offsets, or by going to the parameter `find offset` you click to find offsets.

When in the sample viewing screen you can also change the record level with *E1*.

title: CPU usage 
---

Audio dropouts will occur if the CPU usage gets to high. Onboard synths like [mx.synths](#mx-synths), [infinite pad](#infinite-pad)) can incur a lot of CPU usage, especially when used with long release times and with lots of polyphony. 


In *zxcvbn* there are no hard limits on CPU usage, polyphony, or maximum number of simultaneous tracks. Therefore, if you experience audio dropouts the best solution is usually to reduce the release time to decrease overlaps between notes, reduce polyphony of notes, try to offboard instruments with midi or cv, or (last resort) use [multiple norns devices synced together](#syncing-multiple-norns).

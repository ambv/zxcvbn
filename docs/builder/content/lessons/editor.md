title: Using a different editor
---

The norns itself is the basic editor and controller for creating tracks. However, you can use any editor you want by directly editing a file that is stored on the norns disk in `dust/data/pages/[1-10]`. 

Editing any of these files while *zxcvbn* is running will automatically reload that track (numbered 1-10) and parse it. Conversely - if you edit any track on the norns, the changes will be reflected in these files.

title: Syncing multiple norns
---

If you have 2+ norns, they will automatically sync together if connected onto the same LAN. Each norns will automatically detect the other norns. The norns clock can be set to any setting (`internal`, `crow`, `link`, etc) and any change in tempo will be reflected in the other norns.

In addition, you can have a keyboard on one norns control the others. Simply use *meta*+*0-9* to toggle the keyboard to transmit to another norns. (The *meta* key is sometimes the "Windows" key).

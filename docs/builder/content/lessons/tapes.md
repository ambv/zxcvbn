Each track has its own tape that can be used to record. Currently the tape only records audio input. This feature can be used to sequence an external synth while simultaneously recording it to the internal digital tape.

The tape can be recorded at any time by invoking *ctrl* + *r* on the keyboard. This will "arm" a recording which will start recording the next time the chain starts at the beginning of the first beat. The bottom bar blinks while it is armed, and then turns solid when it begins to record. The bar will grow from the left to the right to indicate the position of the recording. The recording duration is set by the total time for the entire chain.

Once the tape is done recording it will beginning playback. The playback is visualized by a bright line that tracks the position across the gray line. The tape automatically is crossfaded so it seamessly converges back to the beginning. To toggle playback of the digital tape once it is recorded use *ctrl* + *t*.

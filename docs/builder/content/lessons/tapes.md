Each track has its own tape that can be used to record. Currently the tape only records audio input. This feature can be used to sequence an external synth while simultaneously recording it to the internal digital tape.

To use this feature, simply hit *ctrl* + *r*. This will "arm" a recording. You should see a blinking bar at the bottom. The recording will initiate when it starts at the beginning of the chain and will continue until the end of the chain. You should see a growing gray bar at the bottom.

Once the tape is done recording it will beginning playback. The playback is visualized by a bright line that tracks the position across the gray line. The tape automatically is crossfaded so it seamessly converges back to the beginning. To toggle playback of the digital tape once it is recorded use *ctrl* + *t*.

You can tune incoming audio by pressing `ctrl`+`i` while in the main view. Audio through the inputs will cause text onscreen to appear - each side is each channel (they are measured indepednetly). You will see the name of the closest note (e.g. "C3" in this case) and you will see a number indicating the number of semitones away from the note (e.g. +1 in the image).
